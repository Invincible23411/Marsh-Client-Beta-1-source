# Info
Here is Marsh Client Beta v1 source code.
I have spent 10s of hours to bring you this work of... art
It might not be the best but there is more to come soon and i have big plans
You are allowed to use this code for your own use just make sure to credit me in your code.

# Issues
```There maybe problems with Realms```
```Speed is weird i will fix it in the future```
```Anti cobweb seems to be weird when near edge of a block```
```PlayerESP makes your screen green when highliting player (maybe because it highlights you)```
```If issues arise or you have some fixes for it. Make an issue.```

Some modules have been adapted from other clients:
```ItemESP, PlayerESP, StorageESP, MobESP and Tracers - Xdolf```
```FullBright - Cookie Client```
